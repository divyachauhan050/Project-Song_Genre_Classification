# Project - Song Genre Classification

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), I trained a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). I first made use of *pandas* and *seaborn* packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors. 

Next, I used the scikit-learn package to predict whether it correctly classifies a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. I implemented some of the common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, and decision trees.

## About the Datasets
I have used two different datasets (courtesy of Datacamp).
